     <h2>frequently asked questions</h2>
    <h3>what elo are you currently</h3>
<p>i am currently diamond 2, which places me in the 99th percentile of ranked players in North America</p>
<h3>what rank players do you coach></h3>
<p>i coach players anywhere from iron to diamond 4. in my opinion, after that elo, macro becomes more complex, and i don't feel adequete enough in my knowledge to effectively teach it.</p>
<h3>do you coach players outside of North America?</h3>
<p>yes</p>
<h3>what lanes do you coach</h3>
<p>if you are between iron-gold, i can coach any lane, as my knowledge of these roles is strong enough to coach lower elos. However if you are higher than gold, i will only coach midlane, since it is my strongest role.
  <h3>what is your peak elo
  </h3>
  <p> peaked at around diamond 1 60 lp in season 10</p>
